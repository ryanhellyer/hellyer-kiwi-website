				<h2>Testimonials</h2>
				<div class="testimonial">
					<p>The Strattic team has figured out, apparently before everyone else, two things. First, that businesses of every size will continue to choose WordPress so that their marketing teams can quickly edit sites. Second, that those same companies have little risk tolerance for poor performance or security issues. In other words, everyone needs what they’re offering.</p>

					<p>I highly recommend Strattic. The speed increase on our site is great, and the security that they provide is even better, but the best part of Strattic is how responsive their team is to any and all questions we've had.</p>

				<div class="testimonial">
					<p>Believe it or not, website maintenance is always the scariest part for any non-technical founder and our website represents us so its vital it works well, and looks secure for our customers. The team at Strattic helped us get set up in no time and made us feel secure in the entire launch process. Now that our website is hosted on Strattic, our business is stronger than ever and we couldn’t be happier to be part of the Strattic family.</p>

					<p>Strattic places strong focus on helping my company and our team as individuals. In addition to keeping our site secure and radically improving site speed, their support and fast response make it feel like Strattic are an in-house team. The value of Strattic goes beyond their product, they are a true human-to-human company.</p>
