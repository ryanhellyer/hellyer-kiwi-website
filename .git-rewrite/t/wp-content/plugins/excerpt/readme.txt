Automatically converts the content areas on your home, search and archive templates to use excerpts.


== Description ==

Automatically converts the content areas on your home, search and archive templates to use excerpts. Easy to use. Simply install, activate and admire your new excerpted post areas.

= Requirements =
Your theme must display the full content on your home, search or archive pages for this plugin to work.

= Language support =
The plugin includes no text, so all languages are supported :)


== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'excerpt' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And yer done!

Your content areas on your home, archive and search pages will now be displayed as excerpts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where's the plugin settings page? =

There isn't one.

= Does it work in older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but I only actively support the latest version of WordPress. Support for older versions is purely by accident.


= I need custom functionality. Can we pay you to build it for us? =

No, I'm too busy. Having said that, if you are willing to pay me a small fortune then I could <a href="https://ryan.hellyer.kiwi/contact/">probably be persuaded</a>. I'm also open to suggestions for improvements, so feel free to send me ideas and if you are lucky, it may be added for free :)
