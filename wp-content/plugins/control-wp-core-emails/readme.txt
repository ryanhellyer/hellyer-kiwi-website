== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need this? =

Maybe you don't. But this is for people who don't want emails sent on site updates. It can get sort of unruly when you have a lot of sites. And because emails are annoying.

= I would like to edit what the update email contains. Can I do that? =

Probably, but not with this plugin. This is *only* intended to suppress the emails sent, not modify them in any way.

= I have a question / bug report / feature request =
