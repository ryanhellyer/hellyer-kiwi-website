Easily embed Google+ posts into your pages

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to add a Google+ post to your WordPress post or page. It's as easy pasting URL of the post onto it's own line.

== Installation ==

= Embedding with a URL =

Find a Google+ post you want to embed, them click the date/time link on it. This will take you to the URL for that Google+ post.

Copy the URL in your browsers address bar.

Edit the WordPress post or page where you wish to embed the Google+ post and paste the URL onto a line by itself (you don't need to use any embed codes).

Once published, you should see a beautiful Google+ post embedded in your site :)


= Embedding with a shortcode =
You are also able to embed a Google+ post via shortcode. Copy and paste one of the following shortcodes into a post or page. Make sure you change the URL to the one that you want to embed.
