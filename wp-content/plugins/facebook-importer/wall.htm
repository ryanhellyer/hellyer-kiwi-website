I lost a bunch of money through no fault of my own (well partially, but it wasn&#039;t all my fault) and a bunch of other crap went wrong.

This morning I received a phone call from someone wanting to charge me $1600 less for something I was about to buy. Win!

There has also been a really annoying problem I&#039;ve had for a while. When I suggested a potential solution to it, everyone told me that was impossible as it was highly illegal and I wouldn&#039;t find anyone willing to help me. Thankfully, this afternoon I managed to find a small room in the basement of a building, where this dude happily sold me a product which neatly solved my problem. I paid him a bunch of money, he transferred the goods to me and now I have the solution I needed sitting in my pocket!

Yay for me :)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, 17 November 2012 at 01:40 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched Wedding Daze on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 17:57 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of The Last Nazis on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 16:45 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of The Last Nazis on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 15:51 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of The Last Nazis on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 14:54 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched Two Weeks in Hell on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 13:18 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 12:29 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 11:55 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer posted something via RSS Graffiti.<div class="comment">Autumn colours with Marte and Ingvild</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 11:22 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 16 November 2012 at 10:33 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 15 November 2012 at 23:22 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 15 November 2012 at 14:29 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Weapons That Changed the World on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, 13 November 2012 at 12:26 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer watched an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Netflix.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, 13 November 2012 at 04:32 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer shared a link.<div class="comment">Hvor kan jeg finne 80 liter aceton i Oslo?

What the hell is in Norwegian milk that is making me sick? The day I arrived in Norway I became ill. It took me a month to realise it was the milk. I thought maybe I had just become allergic to it over time and not noticed. I&#039;ve discovered I can have Norwegian lactose free milk, but not regular milk. Even a tiny amount of non-lactose free milk makes me ill.

Fast forward a while, and I arrived in Portugal. I accidentally had a giant milkshake, which would normally make me violently ill. It did nothing to me. So I had another one a few days later, and another. Still no ill effects.

Back to Norway ... small glass of regular milk. BAM! My stomach was making all sorts of noises it should not be making!

Any ideas? I&#039;m running out of explanations for my milk issues.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 10 October 2012 at 08:41 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer updated his status.<div class="comment">Dear New Zealand,

If the powers that be are worried about possuming, then I think they are barking up the wrong tree.

They&#039;re failing to realise there is a built in safety mechanism ... the urge to pee. At some point you need to climb down to take a leak. At that point, you realise you are too drunk to climb back up. Problem solved.

Stupid media trying to find a problem which does not exist. We&#039;ve been doing far worse crap for as long as I can recall. Nothing has changed. The only change I have seen is that the media like to glamourise stupid harmless student antics these days. Move along, roll along, nothing to see here.

There&#039;s supposed to be some bible bashing book published soon with photos I took in Israel and an instructional book is being made for pilots with photos I took of ice, to help train them on what to look for when making an emergency landing on a frozen lake.

I am not very good at it and I don&#039;t like it. The last time I attempted to run anywhere was during the mid-1990&#039;s and I did not like it one little bit. I need to run because there isn&#039;t really anything better I can do until my shoulder is healed. I also volunteered to compete in a 10 km run in late April. I was originally aiming to finish the 10 km without dying, but since starting running I have discovered two things, firstly, I am fitter than I thought. I pounded out 3.4 km last week after having done no exercise whatever since around August last year (and very little in the six months before that). Secondly, Dr Bret Dougherty appears to have been correct in that I have a mild case of asthma. Bret gave me some inhalers to try out last year and I only got around to using them properly this evening. I decided to go for a light run and head home before I felt too tired ( as opposed to running till I dropped like last week). I barely broke a sweat, yet managed to churn out 3.0 km very easily (http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=5354786).

In the interests of not munting myself I&#039;m trying to take it easy and avoid over-doing it. I am concerned though about the issues of shin splints etc. I&#039;ve had shin splints before, albeit not from running. When I&#039;ve had shin splints before it has usually been from walking up and down hills for more than 20 km per week for about a month on end. I assume that sort of injury is easier to acquire when running though so I&#039;m keen to avoid anything like that if possible. Simen Thorsrud suggested I run on soft ground, so I jogged along the road to the stream near my house thinking that the surface of the path was soft, but it seems it is actually asphalt (I hadn&#039;t been on it since the snow melted). It turns out that I&#039;m not actually aware of any non-asphalt paths around Oslo. What paths I did think were soft, were just asphalt obscured by snow last time I&#039;d been on them (the snow has melted now).

So ... any tips on where to run and how to avoid injuries for a novice runner?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, 10 March 2012 at 09:32 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer updated his status.<div class="comment">I&#039;m typing this on my Chromebook.

We want to see the northern lights. I assumed that was just a matter of going outside and looking upwards, but there are all sorts of tours advertised. Do we need a tour?

It is currently 3 degrees and raining in Oslo! So much for the land of snow ;)

I have a sim card with unlimited data thanks to Arnstein Larsen, so if you want to get in touch just flick me an email, G+, gChat, Facebook, Skype or MSN message.

I just went to the supermarket and stocked up on food. Despite the horror stories I&#039;ve been getting on the cost of food here, it really wasn&#039;t that bad. I don&#039;t think I would have paid much more in New Zealand. Oddly they seem to package everything up in plastic. Even my broccoli was individually wrapped in plastic!?

New apartment is pretty sweet. Nice big flat screen, decent sized room and very close to the center of the city and not too far from the office either.

I&#039;m going to go cook dinner, perhaps go for a walk, shower, then conk out and hopefully wake up in time to head into the office in the morning.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, 3 January 2012 at 02:35 UTC+01</div>Ryan Hellyer updated his status.<div class="comment">Stranded Frankfurt right now.

My three left&#039;ist fingers are puffy in the middle and the top part of my hand is distinctly fatter than it&#039;s supposed to be. It also hurts somewhat, but nothing dramatic, just enough to be irritating. Or am I perhaps going to die of puffy hand syndrome before I reach Norway?

All this stuff must go, apart from the couches which I&#039;m only going to sell if I can get a decent amount for them (otherwise I&#039;ll leave them there for the new tenants in my flat).

If you want anything, just let me know. In particular, if it doesn&#039;t sell, you are welcome to it for free, coz it&#039;s otherwise going to be thrown out.

I also have a 14&quot; TV which I haven&#039;t bothered listing as well as a large stack of inline skate wheels and bearings, including some brand new wheels. They&#039;re free to a good home. I also have spare dinner sets and other assorted kitchenware junk ideal for someone attempting to kit out the kitchen in a flat.

I wanted to send some sort of holiday greeting to my friends and colleagues, but it is difficult in today&#039;s world to know exactly what to say without offending someone. So I met with my lawyer yesterday, and on advice I wish to say the following:

Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low stress , non addictive, gender neutral celebration of the summer solstice holiday practiced with the most enjoyable traditions of religious persuasion or secular practices of your choice with respect for the religious / secular persuasions and / or traditions of others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all.

I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2012, but not without due respect for the calendar of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make our country great ( not to imply that New Zealand is necessarily greater than any other country ) and without regard to the race, creed, colour, age, physical ability, religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee.

By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms:

This greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for her / him or others and is void where prohibited by law, and is revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher. The wish is warranted to perform as expected within the usual application of good tidings for a period of one year or until the issuance of a new wish at the sole discretion of the wisher.

Best Regards ( without prejudice )

Except they just arrived .... they do work ... they charge my phone and I can transfer data over them ... except, well, my phone USES more power than they charge it with. So if I leave my phone on the charge for a whole day on one of them, it will eventually go flat.

I guess this is a good lesson in why not to be a cheap skate ...

I went to see my surgeon today. He thinks perhaps my original shoulder repair failed before I even dislocated it again. I&#039;m being sent for an MRI scan to see what&#039;s going on inside my shoulder and from there he&#039;ll make a decision about what sort of surgery to perform to repair it.

Combine that with imo.im and you may never need to visit Facebook.com again! Yay :)

EDIT: Now that I think of it, it might still be necessary to go there to visit photos sometimes, but you can at least avoid it for viewing the general FB stream, posting stuff (like I&#039;m doing right now) and replying to people.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 29 July 2011 at 16:39 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer was tagged in Ed Waite&#039;s video 29 July 2011 15:48.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, 26 July 2011 at 00:47 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer posted something via RSS Graffiti.<div class="comment">Camping at Poolburn reservoir</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, 25 July 2011 at 03:18 UTC+02</div>Pierre-Emmanuel de La Bussière wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">joyeux anniversaire

Since everyone keeps asking ... I leave the date incorrect for security reasons. Many services, including banks, use your date of birth for doing security checks.

I&#039;m finding the rest of us all look too different to recognise.

I think that&#039;s Lisa Findley to the left of the red/pink girl holding onto the pole, and Daniel Harwood to Lisa&#039;s right (our left). Maybe Ranui Maxwell beside the lady on the far left? Perhaps Timmy White or Jamie Harvery to Victoria&#039;s right (our left). I recognise the girl in the top left too but can&#039;t remember her name. Miranda Walsh should be in there somewhere too. Bret Mullenger just below Mrs White and maybe Kirsty Burgess to his right (our left)? Karen Hammond beside Kirsty? Rohan Jarvais should be in there somewhere too, but I can&#039;t pick him out.

I assume this is from 1983 as I don&#039;t see Mrs McLeod there and she started working there after I started going to kindy.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 14 July 2010 at 23:43 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer likes Top Gear.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 14 July 2010 at 21:44 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer and Tori Rupene are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 14 July 2010 at 21:44 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer and Merel Burgering are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, 14 July 2010 at 05:07 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer updated his status.<div class="comment">Yay, I can lift my forearm without supporting it now :)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, 13 July 2010 at 10:23 UTC+02</div>Ryan Hellyer updated his status.<div class="comment">My car is stranded at the ice rink and I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll be able to drive it any time soon.

It should be around May that I can skate again.

I totally know where you&#039;re coming from. The conference is taking place in a hotel called the Renaissance, which is not the most expensive, but not cheap. But nothing in Jerusalem is cheap. I actually have a friend who has a small B&amp;B which costs $100 a night. I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to get cheaper than that in Jerusalem, but I&#039;ll look into it.

I&#039;d totally offer you guys to stay by us, but we live in a tiny three bedroom apartment with five kids. I just had another thought - I may know somewhere you could stay for really cheap. I&#039;ll get back to you.

I tend to forget things, so please remind me about all this if you don&#039;t hear back from me.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 21 December 2007 at 00:10 UTC+01</div>Miriam Schwab wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Of course Vicky can come! If she doesn&#039;t come, she&#039;s in big trouble :) And if there&#039;s anyone else you know who&#039;ll be there, they&#039;re welcome too.

I found the website for the conference: http://www.kenes.com/iccc38/. Looks impressive, and the names of some of the organizers look really familiar, but one of them I for sure know since he&#039;s very involved in the Israeli WordPress community! How&#039;s that for coincidence?

They&#039;re offering optional tours, which seem like they&#039;ll be pretty good: http://www.kenes.com/iccc38/optional_tours.asp. But I can give you an insider&#039;s &quot;tour&quot; of Jerusalem.

If you still want to visit Europe, you can set it up so that you travel through there on the way to Israel or back. Also, if you want hotel recommendations, let me know. If you want any kind of advice or information, let me know.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 20 December 2007 at 23:39 UTC+01</div>Miriam Schwab wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">I was so excited to read the first line that I missed that you said it&#039;s in Jerusalem in July.

I might have said something like that early 2005? Having just arrived back in they city I had no idea hockey had got so big here and that there were so many players (not to mention so many people prepared to put the hard yards in and organise it!). No, I may have said that on different info. I think if you have the numbers, which we certainly do now, having the different grades (or having people in multiple grades - I like that idea!) works out better for everyone. The weaker players learn and get stretched by the stronger players and the stronger players get to try out some new and different things (or have to lift their game to balance out the weaker players), or in the A grade, get to practice with similarly strong (or stronger players). Does that make sense? 
NB: I&#039;m still on the computer. Hey, I was just having a look at the forum on the DIHA site. Whose the chuck norris guy? Why doesn&#039;t he organise it next year if he&#039;s so shit hot?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, 7 September 2007 at 03:02 UTC+02</div>Cat Ronayne wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">nice try but I have suffered the agony of iceburn on my belly and yowza - it hurts!

I can understand not going for the C option. I think for lots of Cs they can just be practicing other stuff - and if it was just Cs I don&#039;t know how much they&#039;d get from it. When I was starting out, one of the best things was playing alongside players that were better than me - then they&#039;d set up plays that I&#039;d be part of and learn from. The other thing is having enough players to go around in each grade - which is always tricky anyway when you think you have even teams then only the stronger players turn up on one team (or weaker players/combinations are stronger than on paper) and vice versa. I don&#039;t envy jane&#039;s task and have offered any assistance I may provide (see, more sneaky procrastination...)

See on the left it says &quot;Applications,&quot; and underneath it says Groups, Photos, etc.? See it says &quot;More&quot;? Click on that, and then it says &quot;Notes.&quot; Click on that, and then at the top there is a tab that says &quot;My Notes.&quot; On that page, on the right-hand side, there is a link that says something like &quot;Edit settings.&quot; In there, you can set it up so that your notes are actually your feed from your blog. This will be helpful to you since then you can concentrate on updating your blog, and know that your facebook friends will be updated too.

Tell me if you have any problems or if I didn&#039;t explain this properly.

See, you can only import one RSS feed, which is probably ok for most normal people, but fanatics like me with my three (and soon maybe 4!) blogs could use a way to get more stuff coming in. Maybe that&#039;s where that WordPress plugin you mentioned could come in handy.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, 30 August 2007 at 03:29 UTC+02</div>Miriam Schwab wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Hey Ryan - you beat me to it!
