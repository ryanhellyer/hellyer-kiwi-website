SUBJECT: Upcoming Spa Indycar race
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, and we decided to join in the Indycar race coming up shortly at 20:00 GMT. We noticed that you ran in another Spa Indycar race this week, and we'd love you to come join us at this one too.

And if you'd like to join our regular championship (it features all free cars and the free Dallara Indycar), or to find out about similar events we'll be holding in future, you can join here.

-------------------------------	 INVITING PEOPLE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship invitation
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, which features free cars and tracks from iRacing. Michael Kildevaeld who you have raced with recently recommended you as a good driver to add to the league. Would you be interested in joining us?

The league features very clean drivers, and a selection of oval and road course events. It's very friendly; not too serious, but we try to keep the driving quality very high.

Races are held every Tuesday at 20:00 GMT.

If you are interested, just register here and let me know when you've done that (to make sure you get moved off the reserve driver list):

We are looking for drivers to join season 3 and your name was added into a list of possible candidates. [b]Are you interested in joining?[/b]

We only do races on free tracks and with the free Indycar. Our main league is currently full, but if you are interested, sign up on our website and we'll let you know when we have special events on which you are in eligible for and if a spot opens up in the main championship for you we'll let you know.

Hi [NAME],

-------------------------------	 RACE REMINDER -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race reminder

Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying for round four of the Undiecar Championship at 21:00 GMT tomorrow :) This round will decide who becomes Undiecar Champion! A practice session starts at ~20:00 GMT. Qualifying is two solo laps, and the races are 37 laps long (note that there was an error on the website saying they were 1 lap and 30 mins respectively until recently). The fixed setup this week is the same as the Dallara Dash setup for this track, but with fuel reduced to 49.2 L. It can be [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-oval/]downloaded from the website[/url].

[b]Gap between seasons[/b]
There is no event scheduled for next week. I won't be at my sim racing computer then, but if any of you want to organise something I'm happy to post it on the website and contact everyone to come join in.

The week after (on October 24th) we have the special event at [url=https://undiecar.com/event/long-beach/]Long Beach[/url]. The track only costs US$5 so hopefully most of you will make it.

[b]Season 3[/b]
Season 3 is scheduled to begin on October 31st at the Daytona Moto track. The schedule is not 100% fixed in place just yet, so if you have any strong feelings about it just let me know and changes can still be made.

We current have 65 drivers listed as competing in the championship. I'm going to put the drivers who competed season 2 automatically into the season 3 list (let me know if you don't want added), but those who didn't turn up at all will need to reapply.

We have plenty of drivers turning up each week, but I'd like to fill the whole grid. So with that in mind I'm going to contact a bunch of drivers from Formula Renault, Pro Mazda, Indycars etc. to see if any of them want to join for next season. We have a lot of folk on the waiting list to join, but many of them are only rookies and it's hard to tell if they'll be any good to race against. If the rookies or other lower ranked drivers turn up at the Long Beach special event we can hopefully scope them out and if they're any good ask them to move into the main series.

If you have any suggestions on how the league should be run, changes you'd like made or anything like that, just me know. I'm very open to new ideas.

[b]New drivers[/b]
We seem to have enough drivers now, but if you know of anyone who is a good candidate, just let me know and we can add them to the series. The last few recommendations from existing drivers have been very good.










[b]Bonus point for least incidents[/b]
[url=https://undiecar.com/member/nikolay-ladushkin/]Nikolay[/url] made a suggestion that we give a bonus point to whoever has the least number of incidents per lap and is within one lap of the race winner. This will be applied from this round forward.

[b]Fixed setup for Okayama[/b]
We do not have a fixed setup confirmed for next weeks race at Okayama, but it will be posted on the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/]event page[/url] within the next couple of days for you to download. If you have a preferred setup that we use, please send it to me ASAP so I can test it otherwise we will probably end up using a slightly modified version of the default iRacing high or medium downforce setups.

[b]Profile[/b]
If you haven't done so already, you should edit your [url=https://undiecar.com/member/[NAME_SLUG]/]member profile page[/url]. It would be great if everyone adds their nationality, avatar, header image etc.

-------------------------------	 REJECTED APPLICATION -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship application

MESSAGE:
Hi NAME,
Thanks for signing up to the Undiecar Championship league. Unfortunately our main championship field is totally full at the moment.

You will receive a PM when we hold races that you are eligible for.

-------------------------------	 APOLOGY FOR MASS EMAIL SEND OUT -----------------------------------------
Hi,
It seems I made a mistake, as I grossly underestimated how many people would be interested in this league. It filled up pretty much as soon as I started contacting people to come join. So the league is now overflowing with drivers, but I recommend signing up anyway as there will be some special events held some times which will be open to everybody.

The signup form is here:

-------------------------------	 ACCEPT LEAGUE INVITE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: iRacing league invite
Hi [NAME],
Don't forget that you need to accept the invite to join the Undiecar Championship on iRacing before the race.

You should see an invitation to join here:

-------------------------------	 RACE RESULT -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race 1 Result
Hi [NAME],
Thanks for an awesome race today :)

The results are available to view here:
https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-road/

And I put together a short news item here:
https://undiecar.com/claudius-wied-wins-round-1/

[b]Protest[/b]
I asked the Sim Racers Facebook group to assist with making a decision on Jake's apron driving, which resulted in a five position penalty for race 2:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/wwsimracers/permalink/2009932265904912/

[b]Moving up reserve drivers[/b]
Since we didn't have a full field today, I'm going to send a message to a bunch of the reserve drivers telling them they're now in the main championship. If you see anyone who is still listed in the reserves but who you think should be moved up, just let me know and I'll put them in the main championship.
https://undiecar.com/confirmed-signups/

If people consistently don't turn up we can boot them back into the reserves where they can just join in special events whenever we have them.



-------------------------------	 UPGRADE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Welcome to the Undiecar Championship!
Hi [NAME],
We've had some awesome races in our first two rounds of the Undiecar Championship. It was unfortunate you couldn't join us, but the initial group of drivers were just chosen on a first in first served basis. Quite a few didn't show up though (we only had 21 drivers last night), so you have been hand selected from the 54 people on the reserve list to be added to the championship field :)

[b]Next race[/b]
Qualifying for the next race is on next week September 19th at 21:00 GMT at Okayama International Circuit. Practice starts one hour beforehand.
[url]https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/[/url]
We will be using a fixed setup, but we haven't worked out the details on the setup yet. It will be posted on the event notice within the next day or two.

[b]Schedule[/b]
The full schedule of races is available on the season 2 page:
[url]https://undiecar.com/season/2/[/url]

[b]League signup[/b]
You will receive an invitation to join the league on iRacing shortly. Just accept the invite, and you will be able to join the races.

[b]Wondering why we selected you?[/b]
Nikolay Ladushkin had raced against you previously and saw you were listed in the reserve drivers list already, so recommended we bump you up into the main field.
