-------------------------------	 RACE REMINDER -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race reminder
Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying starts in just over two hours time at 21:00 GMT :)

You can join the race via the hosted races section of iRacing:
[b][url]http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/HostedSessions.do[/url][/b]

There will also be an hour long practice session running before qualifying that you are welcome to join.

The track this week is [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-charlotte/]Charlotte Motor Speedway[/url]. We are using the same setup as used in the Dallara Dash series, but we are racing during the afternoon. Since our races are longer, you [b]will need to make at least one pit stop [/b] and probably two.

[b]Bonus point for least incidents[/b]
[url=https://undiecar.com/member/nikolay-ladushkin/]Nikolay[/url] made a suggestion that we give a bonus point to whoever has the least number of incidents per lap and is within one lap of the race winner. This will be applied from this round forward.

[b]Championship table[/b]
The [url=https://undiecar.com/season/2/]season 2 championship table[/url] is slightly incorrect as I forgot to factor in bonus points. This will be corrected later in the week when I have time to fix the code which generates the points table.

[b]Fixed setup for Okayama[/b]
We do not have a fixed setup confirmed for next weeks race at Okayama, but it will be posted on the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/]event page[/url] within the next couple of days for you to download. If you have a preferred setup that we use, please send it to me ASAP so I can test it otherwise we will probably end up using a slightly modified version of the default iRacing high or medium downforce setups.

[b]Profile[/b]
If you haven't done so already, you should edit your [url=https://undiecar.com/member/[NAME_SLUG]/]member profile page[/url]. It would be great if everyone adds their nationality, avatar, header image etc.







-------------------------------	 PRE-RACE MESSAGE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Next weeks Undiecar Championship round
Hi [NAME],
Next weekends round of the Undiecar Championship takes place next week at [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-charlotte/]Charlotte Motor Speedway[/url].

September 12th
Practice: 20:00 GMT
Qualifying: 21:00 GMT
Race 1: 21:15 GMT
Race 2: ~21:50 GMT

[b]Format[/b]
The same 30 minute sprint followed by 30 min reverse grid format applies, but qualifying is in a two lap solo format. If people prefer the open qualifying like we did at Daytona road just let me know and we can do that for the oval events later in the season.

[b]Practice[/b]
The official practice will start an hour before qualifying. Another practice will be held the night before starting at 19:00 GMT and lasting one hour. I am away on a cycling trip until just before race day, so I may not be able to attend this practice session. I will set some of you as admins on this practice session so that you can kick out any attendees who cause problems (I'll set it as a public session to boost numbers).

[b]Setup[/b]
We will be using the same setup used by the Dallara Dash. Please note that the fuel tank can not last the complete race so [b]you will need to make a pit stop[/b]. Please practice stopping in the pitlane to avoid a mid-race disaster ;) The setup can be downloaded on the event page.

The track time will be the middle of the day. Weather and track conditions will be automatically generated.

There's a practice session on this [XXX] for the [XXX] round coming up on [XXXX] at XX:XX GMT. You will find it in the hosted races section of iRacing. Hopefully you can make it along :)


-------------------------------	 REJECTED APPLICATION -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship application

MESSGE:
Hi [NAME],
Thanks for signing up to the Undiecar Championship league. Unfortunately our main championship field is totally full at the moment, but you are welcome to sign up on our website and you will receive a private message whenever we have special events in which you are eligible to compete or when a spot opens for you in the main championship.

You can register here:
[b][url]https://undiecar.com/register/[/url][/b]




-------------------------------	 APOLOGY FOR MASS EMAIL SEND OUT -----------------------------------------
Hi,
It seems I made a mistake, as I grossly underestimated how many people would be interested in this league. It filled up pretty much as soon as I started contacting people to come join. So the league is now overflowing with drivers, but I recommend signing up anyway as there will be some special events held some times which will be open to everybody.

The signup form is here:
https://undiecar.com/register/



-------------------------------	 ACCEPT LEAGUE INVITE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: iRacing league invite
Hi [NAME],
Don't forget that you need to accept the invite to join the Undiecar Championship on iRacing before the race.

You should see an invitation to join here:

-------------------------------	 RACE RESULT -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race 1 Result
Hi [NAME],
Thanks for an awesome race today :)

The results are available to view here:
https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-road/

And I put together a short news item here:
https://undiecar.com/claudius-wied-wins-round-1/

[b]Protest[/b]
I asked the Sim Racers Facebook group to assist with making a decision on Jake's apron driving, which resulted in a five position penalty for race 2:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/wwsimracers/permalink/2009932265904912/

[b]Moving up reserve drivers[/b]
Since we didn't have a full field today, I'm going to send a message to a bunch of the reserve drivers telling them they're now in the main championship. If you see anyone who is still listed in the reserves but who you think should be moved up, just let me know and I'll put them in the main championship.
https://undiecar.com/confirmed-signups/

If people consistently don't turn up we can boot them back into the reserves where they can just join in special events whenever we have them.



-------------------------------	 UPGRADE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Welcome to the Undiecar Championship!
Hi [NAME],
We've had some awesome races in our first two rounds of the Undiecar Championship. It was unfortunate you couldn't join us, but the initial group of drivers were just chosen on a first in first served basis. Quite a few didn't show up though (we only had 21 drivers last night), so you have been hand selected from the 54 people on the reserve list to be added to the championship field :)

[b]Next race[/b]
Qualifying for the next race is on next week September 19th at 21:00 GMT at Okayama International Circuit. Practice starts one hour beforehand.
[url]https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/[/url]
We will be using a fixed setup, but we haven't worked out the details on the setup yet. It will be posted on the event notice within the next day or two.

[b]Schedule[/b]
The full schedule of races is available on the season 2 page:
[url]https://undiecar.com/season/2/[/url]

[b]League signup[/b]
You will receive an invitation to join the league on iRacing shortly. Just accept the invite, and you will be able to join the races.

[b]Wondering why we selected you?[/b]
Nikolay Ladushkin had raced against you previously and saw you were listed in the reserve drivers list already, so recommended we bump you up into the main field.
