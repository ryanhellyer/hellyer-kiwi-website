-------------------------------	 INVITING INDYCAR DRIVERS -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Upcoming Spa Indycar race
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, and we decided to join in the Indycar race coming up shortly at 20:00 GMT. We noticed that you ran in another Spa Indycar race this week, and we'd love you to come join us at this one too.

[u][size=24][b][url]https://undiecar.com/event/verizon-indycar-series-spa/[/url][/b][/size][/u]

And if you'd like to join our regular championship (it features all free cars and the free Dallara Indycar), or to find out about similar events we'll be holding in future, you can join here.

Hope to see you on track :)





-------------------------------	 INVITING GIRLS -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship invitation
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, which features free cars and tracks from iRacing. We have a welcoming environment and ensure that all drivers are treated with respect (and remove anyone who doesn't meet that description).

We are looking for drivers to join season 3 and your name was added into a list of possible candidates. [b]Are you interested in joining?[/b]

The league features very clean drivers, and a selection of oval and road course events. It's very friendly; not too serious, but we try to keep the driving standards very clean.

[b]Races are held every Tuesday at 20:00 GMT.[/b]

If you are interested, just register here and let me know when you've done that (to make sure you get moved off the reserve driver list):
[size=24][b][url=https://undiecar.com/register/]undiecar.com/register[/url][/b][/size]

We also have some special events, including one on October 24th at Long Beach ... [url]https://undiecar.com/event/long-beach/[/url]

SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship
Hi [NAME],
I'm not sure if you realised, but the hosted Indycar practice at Okayama you participated in earlier was the official practice for the [url=https://undiecar.com/]Undiecar Championship[/url]. We only do races on free tracks and with the free Indycar. Our main league is currently full, but if you are interested, sign up on our website and we'll let you know when we have special events on which you are in eligible for and if a spot opens up in the main championship for you we'll let you know.

You can join the race via the hosted races section of iRacing:

-------------------------------	 RACE REMINDER -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race reminder

Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying for round four of the Undiecar Championship at 21:00 GMT tomorrow :) This round will decide who becomes Undiecar Champion! A practice session starts at ~20:00 GMT. Qualifying is two solo laps, and the races are 37 laps long (note that there was an error on the website saying they were 1 lap and 30 mins respectively until recently). The fixed setup this week is the same as the Dallara Dash setup for this track, but with fuel reduced to 49.2 L. It can be [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-oval/]downloaded from the website[/url].

You can join the race via the hosted races section of iRacing:
[url]http://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/HostedSessions.do[/url]

[b]Gap between seasons[/b]
There is no event scheduled for next week. I won't be at my sim racing computer then, but if any of you want to organise something I'm happy to post it on the website and contact everyone to come join in.

The week after (on October 24th) we have the special event at [url=https://undiecar.com/event/long-beach/]Long Beach[/url]. The track only costs US$5 so hopefully most of you will make it.

[b]Season 3[/b]
Season 3 is scheduled to begin on October 31st at the Daytona Moto track. The schedule is not 100% fixed in place just yet, so if you have any strong feelings about it just let me know and changes can still be made.

We current have 65 drivers listed as competing in the championship. I'm going to put the drivers who competed season 2 automatically into the season 3 list (let me know if you don't want added), but those who didn't turn up at all will need to reapply.

We have plenty of drivers turning up each week, but I'd like to fill the whole grid. So with that in mind I'm going to contact a bunch of drivers from Formula Renault, Pro Mazda, Indycars etc. to see if any of them want to join for next season. We have a lot of folk on the waiting list to join, but many of them are only rookies and it's hard to tell if they'll be any good to race against. If the rookies or other lower ranked drivers turn up at the Long Beach special event we can hopefully scope them out and if they're any good ask them to move into the main series.

If you have any suggestions on how the league should be run, changes you'd like made or anything like that, just me know. I'm very open to new ideas.

[b]New drivers[/b]
We seem to have enough drivers now, but if you know of anyone who is a good candidate, just let me know and we can add them to the series. The last few recommendations from existing drivers have been very good.










[b]Bonus point for least incidents[/b]
[url=https://undiecar.com/member/nikolay-ladushkin/]Nikolay[/url] made a suggestion that we give a bonus point to whoever has the least number of incidents per lap and is within one lap of the race winner. This will be applied from this round forward.

[b]Fixed setup for Okayama[/b]
We do not have a fixed setup confirmed for next weeks race at Okayama, but it will be posted on the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/]event page[/url] within the next couple of days for you to download. If you have a preferred setup that we use, please send it to me ASAP so I can test it otherwise we will probably end up using a slightly modified version of the default iRacing high or medium downforce setups.

If you haven't done so already, you should edit your [url=https://undiecar.com/member/[NAME_SLUG]/]member profile page[/url]. It would be great if everyone adds their country, avatar, header image etc.

-------------------------------	 UPCOMING PRACTICE -----------------------------------------
Hi [NAME],
There's a practice session on this [XXX] for the [XXX] round coming up on [XXXX] at XX:XX GMT. You will find it in the hosted races section of iRacing. Hopefully you can make it along :)




-------------------------------	 APOLOGY FOR MASS EMAIL SEND OUT -----------------------------------------
Hi,
It seems I made a mistake, as I grossly underestimated how many people would be interested in this league. It filled up pretty much as soon as I started contacting people to come join. So the league is now overflowing with drivers, but I recommend signing up anyway as there will be some special events held some times which will be open to everybody.

The signup form is here:
https://undiecar.com/register/



-------------------------------	 ACCEPT LEAGUE INVITE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: iRacing league invite
Hi [NAME],
Don't forget that you need to accept the invite to join the Undiecar Championship on iRacing before the race.

You should see an invitation to join here:

-------------------------------	 RACE RESULT -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race 1 Result
Hi [NAME],
Thanks for an awesome race today :)

The results are available to view here:
https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-road/

And I put together a short news item here:
https://undiecar.com/claudius-wied-wins-round-1/

[b]Protest[/b]
I asked the Sim Racers Facebook group to assist with making a decision on Jake's apron driving, which resulted in a five position penalty for race 2:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/wwsimracers/permalink/2009932265904912/

[b]Moving up reserve drivers[/b]
Since we didn't have a full field today, I'm going to send a message to a bunch of the reserve drivers telling them they're now in the main championship. If you see anyone who is still listed in the reserves but who you think should be moved up, just let me know and I'll put them in the main championship.
https://undiecar.com/confirmed-signups/

If people consistently don't turn up we can boot them back into the reserves where they can just join in special events whenever we have them.



-------------------------------	 UPGRADE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Welcome to the Undiecar Championship!
Hi [NAME],
Sorry for the delay in contacting you. I saw your application to the Undiecar Championship arrive a while ago, but we already had too many drivers at that point so I had to wait to see how many of our latest batch of drivers wouldn't turn up. We no have room, so I've added you to our season 3 list :)

[b]Schedule[/b]
The full schedule of races is available on the season 4 page:
[url]https://undiecar.com/season/4/[/url]

[b]League signup[/b]
You will receive an invitation to join the league on iRacing shortly. Just accept the invite, and you will be able to join the races.

Nikolay Ladushkin had raced against you previously and saw you were listed in the reserve drivers list already, so recommended we bump you up into the main field.

SUBJECT: Reminder: Undiecar qualifying starts in under two hours

Hi [NAME],
Our first qualifying session of the season starts in two hours time (21:00 GMT) and practice will be in around 30 minutes time.
[url]https://undiecar.com/event/season-3-daytona-moto/[/url]

[b]Not intending to compete?[/b]
If you aren't intending to compete in the championship this season, please let me know so that we can remove you from the entry list and free up a spot for another competitor (there are ~150 people on the reserve list).

[b]Start/restart procedure[/b]
I forgot to post on the season announcement page that all races begin with a rolling start. Road courses are unlikely to have any full course cautions as these need to be manually triggered by an admin. On oval courses we will have the normal iRacing full course caution system with lucky dog turned on. It is undecided whether we will use single or double file restarts at this point or whether lapped cars will be at the back or on the outside. If you have an opinion on this please head over to the [url=https://discordapp.com/invite/csjKs6z]Undiecar Discord channel[/url] to discuss it.

[b]Technical issues with race hosting[/b]
We are having constant technical issues when hosting races. If you spot anything out of place please alert us immediately. At the last special event most of us didn't realise we had a standing start until three seconds before the race start, so some pre-warning of technical problems would be nice :)

Some randoms are showing up in the hosted sessions. They are technically blocked as the races are limited to members of the Undiecar Championship, but they somehow find their way in anyway. If you spot one of these, please alert us immediately so that we can remove them. They're usually easy to spot as they're hopelessly off the pace and driving like morons. Don't assume that an idiot intentionally crashing into you is meant to be there. There's a good chance it's just a bug in iRacing which let them into the session ;)

SUBJECT: USA Speedway test race invitation

Hi [NAME],
The Undiecar Championship are hosting a test race at USA International Speedway on [b]Thursday November 16th[/b] which are welcome to compete in.
[b]Practice: 17:30 GMT
Qualifying: 19:00 GMT[/b]

You will find the event in the hosted races section of iRacing.

Full details about the event are on the event notice:

This is a test for experimenting with setups and seeing whether races in the free Dallara IR-05 Indycar work okay on this track.

SUBJECT: Reminder: Undiecar Championship at Lime Rock Park

Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying for the next [url=https://undiecar.com/season/3/]Undiecar Championship round[/url] is at 21:00 GMT on Tuesday :) You will find the event in the hosted races section of iRacing.

Full details about the event are on the event notice:

[b]Schedule[/b]
The full schedule of races is available on the season 3 page:

[b]Fixed setups[/b]
It turns out I had made an error at the Charlotte oval event; sorry about that. The setup used was meant to be the same as one used last season which was already very difficult to drive. Unfortunately, it turns out much of the setup was totally wrong. I don't know how the setup was incorrect, as it was literally meant to be identical to the one from last season. Thankfully Nikolay and Saasha have tested out the Lime Rock Park setup and made some good suggestions for that, so make sure you grab the latest version of the setup from the event notice if you are doing any private testing. If you want to contribute to future fixed setups, just post any suggestions in our Discord chat ... [url]https://discord.gg/csjKs6z[/url].

MESSAGE ABOUT ADMINS ---- MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE MAPPING CODES CORRECTLY


Nikolay Ladushkin,James N Payne,Sascha Lamp,Kleber Bottaro Moura

SUBJECT: Congratulations you are officially an Undiecar admin!

Hi,
You may have noticed that my approach to in-race administration has been a tad crap to say the least. To fix this I've been randomly adding some of you, but usually failing to even bother telling you about it which is kinda stupid.

I added a big stack of people for one race last season, but quickly realised that was a really bad idea as even though people had good intentions, they started making decisions which quickly changed the flow of the race, for example clearing black flags for people who deserved the black flag and giving laps back to people who lost their lap due to their own mistakes. For this reason I limited the number of admins after that.

[b]Button mapping[/b]
For this coming race I've mapped buttons on my wheel for various features, including manually triggering yellow flags ([code]!yellow[/code]), clearing black flags ([code]!black #[car_number][/code]) and removing drivers ([code]!remove #[car_number][/code]). This does still require entering a drivers number, but it's at least slightly easier than trying to use a mouse whilst driving. I'm really bad at entering keys whilst driving, so I may still ask some of you to do tasks if I'm struggling to while at the wheel.

[b]Notice you aren't set as an admin?[/b]
If you are receiving this message, then I'm intending to add you as an admin for every single race. If you notice you are missing the admin priviledges, just let another admin (eg: me) know and they can grant you the priviledge. I need to set the admins for each race, so it's possible I'll forget occasionally.
