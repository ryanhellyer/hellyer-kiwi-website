SUBJECT: Upcoming Spa Indycar race
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, and we decided to join in the Indycar race coming up shortly at 20:00 GMT. We noticed that you ran in another Spa Indycar race this week, and we'd love you to come join us at this one too.

SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship invitation
Hi [NAME],
I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, which features free cars and tracks from iRacing. We have a welcoming environment and ensure that all drivers are treated with respect (and remove anyone who doesn't meet that description).

We are looking for drivers to join season 3 and your name was added into a list of possible candidates. [b]Are you interested in joining?[/b]

The league features very clean drivers, and a selection of oval and road course events. It's very friendly; not too serious, but we try to keep the driving standards very clean.

[b]Races are held every Tuesday at 20:00 GMT.[/b]

If you are interested, just register here and let me know when you've done that (to make sure you get moved off the reserve driver list):
[size=24][b][url=https://undiecar.com/register/]undiecar.com/register[/url][/b][/size]

We also have some special events, including one on October 24th at Long Beach ... [url]https://undiecar.com/event/long-beach/[/url]

Our main league is currently full, but if you are interested, sign up on our website and we'll let you know when we have special events on which you are in eligible for and if a spot opens up in the main championship for you we'll let you know.

-------------------------------	 RACE REMINDER -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race reminder: Charlotte 300 tomorrow

Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying for round four of the Undiecar Championship is on tomorrow at 20:30 GMT :)

[b]Event notice: [url]https://undiecar.com/event/season-4-charlotte-300/[/url][/b]

[b]Test race this Thursday[/b]
We will be running an open setup test race on Thursday to iron out a race setup for the event at Okayam on the following Tuesday.
[url=https://undiecar.com/event/okayama-dash/]Okayama test on Thursday[/url]

[b]Discord voice chat[/b]
We had a blast on Discord Voice Chat during the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/indianapolis-road-dash/]special event last Thursday[/url]. It would be great if more of you hopped on to join in the chit chat.
Discord: [b][url]https://discord.gg/csjKs6z[/url][/b]

[b]Photo gallery[/b]
We have a new [url=https://undiecar.com/gallery/]gallery page[/url] on the website, where you can upload images from our races. You can set the season/event/drivers involved, and the images will appear on the relevant pages. Any images you are tagged in, will now appear on your Undiecar member page. You can also post images in the #undiecar-photos Discord channel and they'll automatically appear in the websites gallery. It would be great if some of you uploaded images to keep as a record of our races together.

[b]Manual pace car[/b]
We ran a manual pace car (expertly driven by[url=https://undiecar.com/member/james-n-payne/]James N Payne[/url]) during the special event on Thursday. Despite almost no instruction being given to the drivers, this worked extremely well. We will do another test of the manual pace during the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/okayama-dash/]Okayama test on Thursday[/url], and if this goes to plan, we may deploy that for the next road course round of the main championship. You can [b][url=https://undiecar.com/manual-pace-car/]read more about the manual pace process here[/url][/b].

[b]Grumpiness[/b]
Please note rule #3 here ... [url]https://undiecar.com/rules/[/url]
I play games to have fun, not to have silly arguments :P

[b]New drivers[/b]
We seem to have enough drivers now, but if you know of anyone who is a good candidate, just let me know and we can add them to the series. The last few recommendations from existing drivers have been very good.










[b]Bonus point for least incidents[/b]
[url=https://undiecar.com/member/nikolay-ladushkin/]Nikolay[/url] made a suggestion that we give a bonus point to whoever has the least number of incidents per lap and is within one lap of the race winner. This will be applied from this round forward.

[b]Fixed setup for Okayama[/b]
We do not have a fixed setup confirmed for next weeks race at Okayama, but it will be posted on the [url=https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-okayama/]event page[/url] within the next couple of days for you to download. If you have a preferred setup that we use, please send it to me ASAP so I can test it otherwise we will probably end up using a slightly modified version of the default iRacing high or medium downforce setups.

[b]Profile[/b]
If you haven't done so already, you should edit your [url=https://undiecar.com/member/[NAME_SLUG]/]member profile page[/url]. It would be great if everyone adds their country, avatar, header image etc.

-------------------------------	 UPCOMING PRACTICE -----------------------------------------
Hi [NAME],
There's a practice session on this [XXX] for the [XXX] round coming up on [XXXX] at XX:XX GMT. You will find it in the hosted races section of iRacing. Hopefully you can make it along :)




-------------------------------	 APOLOGY FOR MASS EMAIL SEND OUT -----------------------------------------
Hi,
It seems I made a mistake, as I grossly underestimated how many people would be interested in this league. It filled up pretty much as soon as I started contacting people to come join. So the league is now overflowing with drivers, but I recommend signing up anyway as there will be some special events held some times which will be open to everybody.

The signup form is here:
https://undiecar.com/register/



-------------------------------	 ACCEPT LEAGUE INVITE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: iRacing league invite
Hi [NAME],
Don't forget that you need to accept the invite to join the Undiecar Championship on iRacing before the race.

You should see an invitation to join here:

-------------------------------	 RACE RESULT -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Race 1 Result
Hi [NAME],
Thanks for an awesome race today :)

The results are available to view here:
https://undiecar.com/event/season-2-daytona-road/

And I put together a short news item here:
https://undiecar.com/claudius-wied-wins-round-1/

[b]Protest[/b]
I asked the Sim Racers Facebook group to assist with making a decision on Jake's apron driving, which resulted in a five position penalty for race 2:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/wwsimracers/permalink/2009932265904912/

[b]Moving up reserve drivers[/b]
Since we didn't have a full field today, I'm going to send a message to a bunch of the reserve drivers telling them they're now in the main championship. If you see anyone who is still listed in the reserves but who you think should be moved up, just let me know and I'll put them in the main championship.
https://undiecar.com/confirmed-signups/

If people consistently don't turn up we can boot them back into the reserves where they can just join in special events whenever we have them.



-------------------------------	 UPGRADE -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Welcome to the Undiecar Championship!

Hi [NAME],
Sorry for the delay in contacting you. I saw your application to the Undiecar Championship just now amongst 50 others. 49 have been rejected, you have not ;)

Our next race is on Tuesday at 20:30 GMT. You can see the full schedule of races on the season 4 page:
[url]https://undiecar.com/season/4/[/url]

[b]Website account[/b]
Our normal application process is actually through our website. We needed you registered there to add you to the season 4 drivers list, so I registered an account for you.

Name: [FULL_NAME]
Password: [PASSWORD]
Profile page: [url]https://undiecar.com/member/[NAME_SLUG]/[/url]
Login page: [url]https://undiecar.com/login/[/url]

[b]Discord[/b]
If you have any questions, just ask in the Undiecar Discord channel. I'm not very good at responding here via private message, but there's someone around on Discord to help out.
[url]https://discord.gg/csjKs6z[/url]

[b]Communication[/b]
I send out a private message one or two days (sometimes both) before the event. This will include any recent changes which may have occurred in the league.

[b]Joining races[/b]
The races are run as a tournament. You can find them in the normal iRacing hosted races section. They are [b]not[/b] in the league sessions (this is because we can't do double headers with the second race as reversed grid via league sessions).


[img]https://undiecar.com/files/daytona-moto1.jpg[/img]









[b]Wondering why we selected you?[/b]
Nikolay Ladushkin had raced against you previously and saw you were listed in the reserve drivers list already, so recommended we bump you up into the main field.











-------------------------------	 SPECIAL EVENT INVITE - special events folk only -----------------------------------------
SUBJECT: Special event: Indianapolis road track
Hi [NAME],
We're running a test race at the Indianapolis road track on Friday. This event allows open setups, as we need to work out a suitable fixed setup for the Undie Grand Prix which will be happening in the gap between our seasons.

[b]Time[/b]
Friday December 29th
Qualifying: 19:00 GMT (90 min open session)
Race: 20:30 GMT (30 mins)

[b]Event notice: [url]https://undiecar.com/event/indianapolis-road-dash/[/url]


[b]Starts[/b]
We may trial the use of a manual pace car in this event. We will explain how this works in the session.

[b]Discord[/b]
If you want to discuss the race or ask any questions, please check out the Undiecar Discord channel. You can also join our audio chat there during the race if you like.

SUBJECT: Reminder: First race of season 4 tomorrow :)

Hi [NAME],
Our first race of the season starts tomorrow at 20:30 GMT at Daytona Road. If you aren't intending to compete in the championship this season, please let me know.
[b]Event notice: [url]https://undiecar.com/event/season-4-daytona-road/[/url][/b]

We also have a fun event on Thursday at Summit Point:

If you aren't aware of the rules regarding driving ton the Daytona Road apron or exiting the pits at Charlotte road (next weeks race), please check out the following links:
[url]https://undiecar.com/daytona-road-apron/[/url]
[url]https://undiecar.com/charlotte-road-pit-exit/[/url]


[b]Some changes from last season[/b]

[u]Cautions[/u]: Race restarts will now be single file. This has changed due to some concerns over too many incidents occurring during race restarts. We will be keeping the lucky dog on though.

[u]Cautions on road courses:[/u] We have live race control for road courses now, courtesy of [url=https://undiecar.com/member/james-n-payne/]James N Payne[/url]. This allows us to trigger caution periods on road courses to bunch the pack up. We are aiming for one caution per race, but it could be more, or could be done, only James will know. The cautions are more likely to occur during the middle stage of the race.

[u]Pit stops:[/u] Fuel levels will be set to 55% to force a mid-race pit stop (in previous seasons the fuel level was fixed via the car setup)

[u]Fast repairs:[/u] Almost no one has needed more than one fast repair in the past two seasons. In the few cases were someone has required more than one fast repair, that driver usually was too accident prone in the event, and so we've removed the unlimited fast repairs.

[u]Teams, road and oval championships:[/u] We now have a teams championship to allow you to compete with others on the same team. If you aren't already on a team, feel free to ask to join an existing one or create your own (single driver teams are allowed). The website will also be showing points tables for the best drivers on road and oval tracks.


[b]Discord[/b]
If you want to discuss anything, please head on over to the [url=https://discordapp.com/invite/csjKs6z]Undiecar Discord channel[/url] to discuss it.

Hi [NAME],
This is just a reminder that qualifying for the next [url=https://undiecar.com/season/3/]Undiecar Championship round[/url] is at 21:00 GMT on Tuesday :) You will find the event in the hosted races section of iRacing.

Full details about the event are on the event notice:

[b]Schedule[/b]
The full schedule of races is available on the season 3 page:

[b]Fixed setups[/b]
It turns out I had made an error at the Charlotte oval event; sorry about that. The setup used was meant to be the same as one used last season which was already very difficult to drive. Unfortunately, it turns out much of the setup was totally wrong. I don't know how the setup was incorrect, as it was literally meant to be identical to the one from last season. Thankfully Nikolay and Saasha have tested out the Lime Rock Park setup and made some good suggestions for that, so make sure you grab the latest version of the setup from the event notice if you are doing any private testing. If you want to contribute to future fixed setups, just post any suggestions in our Discord chat ... [url]https://discord.gg/csjKs6z[/url].

MESSAGE ABOUT ADMINS ---- MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE MAPPING CODES CORRECTLY


Nikolay Ladushkin,James N Payne,Sascha Lamp,Kleber Bottaro Moura

SUBJECT: Congratulations you are officially an Undiecar admin!

Hi,
You may have noticed that my approach to in-race administration has been a tad crap to say the least. To fix this I've been randomly adding some of you, but usually failing to even bother telling you about it which is kinda stupid.

I added a big stack of people for one race last season, but quickly realised that was a really bad idea as even though people had good intentions, they started making decisions which quickly changed the flow of the race, for example clearing black flags for people who deserved the black flag and giving laps back to people who lost their lap due to their own mistakes. For this reason I limited the number of admins after that.

[b]Button mapping[/b]
For this coming race I've mapped buttons on my wheel for various features, including manually triggering yellow flags ([code]!yellow[/code]), clearing black flags ([code]!black #[car_number][/code]) and removing drivers ([code]!remove #[car_number][/code]). This does still require entering a drivers number, but it's at least slightly easier than trying to use a mouse whilst driving. I'm really bad at entering keys whilst driving, so I may still ask some of you to do tasks if I'm struggling to while at the wheel.

[b]Notice you aren't set as an admin?[/b]
If you are receiving this message, then I'm intending to add you as an admin for every single race. If you notice you are missing the admin priviledges, just let another admin (eg: me) know and they can grant you the priviledge. I need to set the admins for each race, so it's possible I'll forget occasionally.







-------- REMOVED FROM LEAGUE --------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship

Hi [NAME],
We haven't seen you around the Undiecar Championship for a while, so you haven't been added to the season 4 drivers list. You are welcome to join if you intend to attend the races though, so just let me know if this is the case and I'll add you back in for season 4 :)

You will still receive private messages whenever we hold special events which you are eligible for.






-------------------------------	 INVITING PEOPLE -----------------------------------------
Pro Mazda


SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship invitation
Hi [NAME],
I noticed you have run some races recently in the Pro Mazda series. I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, which features the free Dallara Indycar and free tracks from iRacing. Would you be interested in joining us? The car is really fun to drive, much more powerful than the Pro Mazda but way easier than the F1 cars in iRacing.

The league features very clean drivers, and a selection of oval and road course events. It's very friendly; not too serious, but we try to keep the driving quality high.

Regular championship races are held every Tuesday at 20:30 GMT.

If you are interested, just register here and let me know when you've done that (to make sure you get moved off the reserve driver list):
[size=18][b][url=https://undiecar.com/register/]undiecar.com/register[/url][/b][/size]

SUBJECT: Teams Championship

Hi [NAME],
I'm trying to kick start the teams championship for season 4, but only two teams applied and one was short on drivers. So I've just started assigning people into arbitrarily named teams. If you don't want to be in a team, or prefer to be on a different one, just let me know and I'll reassign you. Being in a team doesn't require you to do anything, it just adds an extra element of interest to the championship.

Full team list (including your name) can found on the following page:
[b][url]https://undiecar.com/season/4/?test[/url][/b]
[size=10](adding "test" to the URL makes the preliminary teams list show up)[/size]

I've mostly just included those of you are fairly reliable. The two actual teams that signed up already have a third driver. Feel free to recruit a third driver to your team (just let me know so that I add them officially so that they get points).
