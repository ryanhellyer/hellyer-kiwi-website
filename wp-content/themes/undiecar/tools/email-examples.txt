-------------------------------	 PRE-RACE MESSAGE -----------------------------------------
Hi [NAME],
Our first event in the Undiecar Championship is coming up on Monday at 21:00 GMT. A practice session for it will start one hour beforehand.

Qualifying is a 15 minute long open session (everyone on track). There are two 30 minute back to back races so don't drop out once the first one is completed ;)

We will be using the Road Medium setup.
Race time will be set to afternoon.
Weather will be randomly chosen by iRacing.
Marbles will not be cleaned between sessions.

If you want to chit chat about the race, check out the Undycar Discord channel:

BTW, you may have noticed that the name of the championship changed slightly since you joined up ;) This was due to concerns over legal implications of mimicing the Indycar Series too closely. Undycar Series was easily mistaken as Indycar Series.
