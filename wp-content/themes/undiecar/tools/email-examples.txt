SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship
Hi [NAME],
I saw your application to the Undiecar website arrive. Thanks for joining

Are you interested joining our main championship in the Dallara IR-05 Indycar? If so, I can add you to our season 5 drivers list:
[b][url]https://undiecar.com/season/5/[/url][/b]


We are also working on an Undie Lights Championship at the moment too, which will feature the Skip Barber and Spec Racer Ford cars. I'll be sending out more information about that series closer to the time. It won't require registration, unlike our main Indycar championship:

MESSAGE ABOUT ADMINS ---- MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE MAPPING CODES CORRECTLY


Nikolay Ladushkin,James N Payne,Sascha Lamp,Kleber Bottaro Moura

SUBJECT: Congratulations you are officially an Undiecar admin!

Hi,
You may have noticed that my approach to in-race administration has been a tad crap to say the least. To fix this I've been randomly adding some of you, but usually failing to even bother telling you about it which is kinda stupid.

I added a big stack of people for one race last season, but quickly realised that was a really bad idea as even though people had good intentions, they started making decisions which quickly changed the flow of the race, for example clearing black flags for people who deserved the black flag and giving laps back to people who lost their lap due to their own mistakes. For this reason I limited the number of admins after that.

[b]Button mapping[/b]
For this coming race I've mapped buttons on my wheel for various features, including manually triggering yellow flags ([code]!yellow[/code]), clearing black flags ([code]!black #[car_number][/code]) and removing drivers ([code]!remove #[car_number][/code]). This does still require entering a drivers number, but it's at least slightly easier than trying to use a mouse whilst driving. I'm really bad at entering keys whilst driving, so I may still ask some of you to do tasks if I'm struggling to while at the wheel.

[b]Notice you aren't set as an admin?[/b]
If you are receiving this message, then I'm intending to add you as an admin for every single race. If you notice you are missing the admin priviledges, just let another admin (eg: me) know and they can grant you the priviledge. I need to set the admins for each race, so it's possible I'll forget occasionally.







-------- REMOVED FROM LEAGUE --------
SUBJECT: Undiecar Championship

Hi [NAME],
We haven't seen you around the Undiecar Championship for a while, so you haven't been added to the season 4 drivers list. You are welcome to join if you intend to attend the races though, so just let me know if this is the case and I'll add you back in for season 4 :)

You will still receive private messages whenever we hold special events which you are eligible for.

Hi [NAME],
I noticed you have run some races recently in the Indy road series. I run a league called the Undiecar Championship, which features the free Dallara Indycar and free tracks from iRacing. Would you be interested in joining us?

The league features very clean drivers, and a selection of oval and road course events. It's very friendly; not too serious, but we try to keep the driving quality high.

Regular championship races are held every Tuesday at 20:30 GMT.

If you are interested, just register here and let me know when you've done that (to make sure you get moved off the reserve driver list):

MESSAGE:
Hi [NAME],
We're just wondering if you are still intending to compete in the Undiecar Championship?

We've been having lots of fun this season, but noticed you hadn't been attending any events. 
It would be awesome if you want to keep racing with us :)

It would be great if you still want to compete, but if not (or if I don't hear back from you) then I'll drop your name off the season 5 drivers list in a few days time. You are welcome to come back any time, but you wouldn't receive the weekly private messages about our main championship events, and if we ended up overflowing with drivers at some point, then you would need to wait until a spot frees up.
